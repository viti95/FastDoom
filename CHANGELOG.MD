* Better sound caching
* Improved management of low memory scenarios

## 1.0.1 (13 Sep 2024)
* Fixed frameskipping in 35 fps mode not working properly

## 1.0.0 (11 Sep 2024)
* Optimized rendering of non-scaled graphics (skybox and player sprite, only on 320x200 modes and screensize >= 10)
* Added player sprite rendering display option (player weapon)
* Fix issue #203. Now savegames are different for each IWAD
* Fix issue on command line parameter "-iwad"
* Faster update rate for the onscreen FPS counter (@tigrouind)
* Reduced memory usage
* Fixed map names for FreeDoom (now map names are stored in the folder "LEVELS")
* New uncapped framerate mode, for fast 486/Pentium machines (@dougvj)
* Fixed VSync code (@dougvj)
* Fixed FDBENCH.EXE utility

## 0.9.9f (27 Jul 2024)
* Dreamblaster S2P support (MIDI through LPT)
* New rendering options, now it's possible to draw walls and sprites untextured (single color)
* Update display options menu, scroll it's available so it's possible to add as many options as wanted
* Optimize flat sky rendering
* Two new command line options "-freeram" and "-limitram". First one limits the amount of ram available for zone memory (kb), and second limits the ammount of memory free after allocating zone memory (also in kb). Reverted default free memory to 128kb (fixes issues on some setups) @jsmolina
* Added file size verification for supported IWADs (in order to reduce unsupported IWAD version issues)

## 0.9.9e (18 Jun 2024)
* Fixed diminished lightning issues on high resolution VESA modes
* Fixed some 2D status bar and menus misalignements
* Fixed rendering corruption on VESA 386SX codepath
* Fixed MS-DOS 7 crash #187
* New fonts for 320x100 resultion modes (half height)
* Optimizations (C)

## 0.9.9d (30 May 2024)
* VESA 400x300 modes support
* Fixed issue #181 (FastDoom crashes on exit when using AWE32 music device + SoftMPU). Thanks @TheElf01 for finding this issue.
* Multiple optimizations (C)
* New VGA 320x100 executable. Uses same direct rendering method as vanilla Doom, but with half height resolution. High detail resolution is 320x100, low detail 160x100 and potato detail 80x100. Recommended for slow 386 cpu's with VGA cards. 2D elements also have half height resolution, so text is pretty much unreadable (unless someone creates a WAD with optimized fonts for this mode)
* Fixed issue #192 (Save game buffer overflow). Now saving on MAP24 of Hell Revealed doesn't crash. Thanks @deat322 for finding this issue.
* Added debug to file support for debugging (only for developers)

## 0.9.9c (07 Apr 2024)

* Fixed MDA debug, now text don't blink all the time
* Fixed issue #183, random crashes on low-res executables
* Fixed issue #62, videocards with more than 8Mb crashed on VESA modes
* Removed "-singletics" commandline parameter. It was only used for debugging purposes.
* Upgraded build scripts
* Removed MS-DOS/Windows build scripts. Those were pretty much outdated, and all tooling now is Linux based. It's possible to build FastDoom on Windows using WSL2.

## 0.9.9 (24 Mar 2024)
* Multiple optimizations (C, ASM) and code cleanup
* Disabled all cheats in Nightmare
* Removed IDSPIDPOPD cheat (IDCLIP is still available)
* Fixed snow while setting palette on slow VGA cards (via -fixDAC)

* Fixed SBEMU support (thanks to Crazii)
* Refactored memory allocation, now all RAM available is used by default. Removed -ram command line parameter
* Better debugging and automatic CPU detection by Doug Johnson
* Source code has 8.3 file format again (thanks to efliks)
* VESA backbuffered modes now work on video cards without LFB
* Removed OpenWatcom IDE files (obsolete, not used)
* Upgraded build scripts, much faster compile times on Linux (again, thanks to Doug Johnson)

## 0.9.8 (01 Sep 2023)
* Add DEMO4 to benchmark menu
* Optimized all non-VGA modes (ASM)
* Replace uncapped fps setting with new bus speed setting. This option is useful for 8-bit ISA cards on mode 13h.
* Added CPU class detection (386, 486, 586...) to avoid crashes if some render codepath uses non-available instructions
* Additional sound card initialization checks to avoid crashes at startup

## 0.9.7 (16 Jul 2023)
* Add CPU selection for different render paths
* Optimized flat visplane rendering (handcrafted ASM)
* Optimized column rendering for some CPUs (Ken Silverman)
* Upgrade FPS display, now it's possible to show FPS on-screen and on a debug card at the same time
* Debug card port is now selectable on fdoom.cfg file. Full support for 4 digit debug cards
* Fixed issue #148. Now it's possible to use SB-MIDI and Sound Blaster Direct Mode without crashing
* Upgrade display menu, now it's possible to select options using left/right keys (previous/next)
* Optimized fuzz column redering (handcrafted ASM)
* Optimized fuzz flat column rendering (handcrafted ASM)
* Optimized backbuffered non-VGA modes. EGA 320x200 16-color mode should be much faster now
* New in-game menu for benchmarks. Now it's possible to execute multiple benchmarks without reloading the game
* Automatically detect MDA/Hercules video card in FDSetup
* Updated bench.bat (new in-game benchmark options). Also new FDBench executable to make easier to launch benchmarks from commmandline (FDBENCH.EXE)
* New advanced benchmark, which stores frametimes on file ftime.csv. Also calculates 1% low and 0.1% low frametimes, which are saved on bench.csv file. Now you will be able to create videos like Digital Foundry :D
* New commandline parameter to execute benchmarks:
    * Single benchmark with current parameters: -benchmark single [demofile] [-advanced]
    * Multiple benchmark: -benchmark file [demofile] [benchmarkfile] [-advanced]
    * [-advanced] is optional (frametimes)

## 0.9.6 (13 May 2023)
* Add executable filename to benchmark (CSV)
* Fix wrong fps display if 0XX after decimal point (@RamonUnch #145)
* New invisible column renderer: Flat Sega Saturn (@RamonUnch idea)
* Small code optimizations
* Sound Blaster MIDI support (for Sound Blaster 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, Pro 1.0 and Pro 2.0)

## 0.9.5 (28 Apr 2023)
* Sigma Designs Color 400 support. 320x200 and 16 colors. Tested only in 86Box, as I cannot make my card work on my 386/486 PCs.
* Added low and potato detail for backbuffered and VBE2 direct modes
* Removed FDOOME80.EXE and FDOOMEW1.EXE, not needed with new detail modes. They were also very half-baked, HUD was basically non-readable
* Removed FDOOMV16.EXE, didn't fit properly in the project. Is a cool hack to get VGA 160x200 and 16-colors, but Doom already supports 256 color modes which also are much faster
* Removed FastDoom VGA vertical mode. Started as a joke, and I don't feel it matches the project spirit. If people want's it back, I'll reconsider it.
* Speed up CGA, EGA, Plantronics and Hercules video modes by optimizing in ASM the backbuffer->VRAM copy routines
* Better benchmarking options, now FastDoom is able to generate CSV data (easier to import in Excel)
* Added BENCH.BAT script. This script makes easier to benchmark FastDoom. How to use it:
    * bench.bat {type} {exe} {iwad} {lmp}
    * {type}:  {phil, quick, normal, full}
        * {phil}: Same benchmarks as define by PhilsComputerLab DOOM benchmark
        * {quick}: Full screen + HUD, tests potato, low and high detail modes
        * {normal}: Full screen + HUD, tests potato, low and high detail modes, and different visplane rendering modes
        * {full}: Multiple screen sizes, tests all detail settings (will take a long time if the system is slow)
    * {exe}:  {fdoom.exe, fdoom13h.exe, ...}
    * {iwad}:  {doom1.wad, doomu.wad, doom2.wad, ...}
    * {lmp}:  {demo1, demo2, ...}
    * Example: bench.bat phil fdoom.exe doom1.wad demo3
    * Results are stored in the file "bench.csv"
* New invisible object rendering mode, now it's possible to use Heretic/Hexen translucency for objects. Cached tintmap files are stored in binary .TCF files. This rendering method only looks great on 256-color modes.
* Sound FX support for OPL2LPT and OPL3LPT devices.
* Enabled Ensoniq Soundscape music and sound FX devices. Not tested as I don't have one of these devices.
* Renamed multiple command line arguments. Take a look at the README.TXT to see what has changed.
* Fixed issue #139
* Removed "-simplestatusbar" command line parameter. Performance difference was pretty much none, and looked terribly bad.
* Cleanup unused Extended MIDI support from Apogee Sound System.
* Small optimizations for rendering code

## 0.9.4 (15 Mar 2023)
* PCM music support. Up to 44.1 KHz, 8-bit mono music. For now PCM music is stored in RAM, so more than 16Mb is recommended
* Tandy 3-voice SN76489 sound support. Sound quality is nowhere near good, but can be improved
* Sound frequency is now selectable (from 7KHz up to 44.1KHz). Removed "-lowsound" parameter since is not needed anymore
* Updated PLAYPAL+COLORMAPS for B&W, 4-color and 16-color modes thanks to @deat322 (@Deathz0r). The image quality is much better now on non-256 color modes
* Fixed issues #95, #133, #134 and #135
* Made source code buildable again on 8.3 filesystems (DOS)
* Updated FDSetup program
* Removed "Tandy Sound Source" sound card. This was the same as Disney Sound Source, but for old Tandy with incompatible parallel port

## 0.9.3 (16 Jan 2023)
* AudioCD music support. Custom AudioCD mappings for (Ultimate) Doom, Doom II, TNT and Plutonia. (thanks @theelf for testing and the idea!)
* Fixed bugs on Hercules automap mode (thanks @Darmok for testing)
* Small optimizations in rendering code

## 0.9.2 (19 Dic 2022)
* New video mode, IBM CGA 80x100 "512 color" mode with composite output (available for old and new IBM CGA cards)
* Optimized R_DrawColumnPotato and R_DrawSpanPotato for Potato mode in FDOOM.EXE, up to 22% more FPS
* Optimized R_DrawColumnLow for Low detail in FDOOM.EXE, up to 10% more FPS
* Optimized R_DrawColumn for High detail in FDOOM.EXE, up to 10% more FPS
* FDOOMEGA.EXE now uses same thechnique as FDOOME14.EXE but with full 16 colors, so FDOOME14.EXE has been removed as is not needed anymore (and now FDOOMEGA.EXE is much faster)
* Huge video code refactor, much easier to create and mantain new video modes (no changes in terms of performance)
* Removed VGA 80x100 and EGA 80x86 text modes. Too slow on real hardware, they required lot's of VRAM reads which are very slow
* Removed EGA 160x100 text mode. Other EGA video modes offer much better quality, and have better aspect ratio
* Removed 136 pseudo-color modes, as CGA modes have been superseeded with better ones, same for EGA/VGA
* Minor optimizations here and there

## 0.9.1 (7 Nov 2022)
* Creative Music System (Game Blaste) music support by @Tronix286
* New EGA 160x200 (16 color) mode FDOOMEW1.EXE, fast on 8-bit ISA cards
* New EGA 320x200 (14 color) mode FDOOME14.EXE, much faster on 8-bit ISA cards compared to FDOOMEGA.EXE
* Updated FastDoom Setup program with new music devices. Support for MDA / Hercules video cards using parameter "-mono"
* New CGA ANSI from Hell mode, based on the same idea of Area5150. Base resolution of 320x100 and 16 colors. Not perfect but awesome for CGA cards.
* Add SBK soundfont loading support for Creative AWE32/AWE64 sound cards by @Tronix286. Use parameter "-sbk".
* Updated startup menu, now it only shows available WADs. Also experimental support for FreeDoom Phase 1+2.
* New command line parameter "-iwad" to load any IWAD directly
* Fixed Plutonia MAP12 crash by @Tronix286 and @RamonUnch
* Small bugfixes and optimizations

## 0.9 (14 Oct 2022)
* Fixed lot's of crashing bugs. May be a performance impact, but it's better than crashing the whole game. Huge thanks to @RamonUnch for discovering the issues, and providing extensive testing in lots of maps and demos.
* Added commandline parameter "-palette1" to enable the black-cyan-magenta-white palette on CGA 320x200 mode.
* Added commandline parameter "-snow" to enable a fix snow bug in IBM CGA cards on modes 160x100 16-color and 80x100 136-color.
* Added basic compatibility levels support. Now demos wont desync. Also again huge thanks to @RamonUnch. And thanks Decino for the marvelous video explaining the compatibility levels.
    * Added commandline parameter "-complevel X" to select any compatibility level
    * Supported compatibility levels are:
        * 2 -> Doom 1.9 (also Doom II)
        * 3 -> Ultimate Doom
        * 4 -> Final Doom
* Added OPL2LPT and OPL3LPT support by Jordi Sesmero (@jsmolina)
* Added new video mode FDOOME80.EXE => FastDoom EGA 80x200 16-color. This video mode is 640x200 EGA mode with write mode 2 enabled, so we can write 8 pixels at the same time with a single 8-bit write (that's 32-bit written at once, and avoiding the chunky2planar process). Should perform well on 8-bit ISA EGA cards.
* Updated FastDoom Setup program with the new music devices. Also small visual fixes.
* As always small optimizations here and there.

## 0.8.16 (21 Aug 2022)
* Added Creative Music System / Game Blaster PCM support (4-bit stereo DAC)
* Added PC Speaker PWM support (now working properly, CPU intensive)
* Disney Sound Source / COVOX parallel port now is selectable (FDSetup)
* Remove -LPTx command line parameters as they are now not needed
* Fixed flickering in MDA video mode.

## 0.8.15 (06 Jul 2022)
* Added Adlib PCM support (yeah that OPL2 can do that)
* Optimizations in sound code
* "Better" quality PC Speaker (1-bit)
* Fixed Hercules automap on modes Y and VBD

## 0.8.14 (16 Jun 2022)
* Performance uplift, avoid AGI stalls on column and visplane rendering code (486). Also small optimizations in sound code.
* Dual screen support. Now it's possible to use an Hercules card/monitor to render the automap. Use the command line parameter '-hercmap'.
* Better performance on 8-bit ISA cards and special backbuffered modes (Hercules, CGA, Plantronics ColorPlus, EGA, ATI 640x200).
* Removed Hercules 640x200 mode. It only worked on emulators, didn't work at all on real hardware. Even can cause serious problems on B&W monitors.
* Added transparent automap support. Press 'T' while on automap mode. Only supported while in 'fullscreen' mode.

## 0.8.13 (02 Jun 2022)
* Small performance uplift

## 0.8.12 (27 Apr 2022)
* New video mode: IBA MDA text mode. Just for fun, quick'n'dirty
* Small optimization on gameplay code and melting screen functions
* Fixed corruption on VGA palettes (issue #75)

## 0.8.11 (11 Apr 2022)
* Optimized backbuffered video modes: Hercules, CGA B&W, Plantronics ColorPlus, EGA, ATI 640x400
* Small optimization on multiple modulo operations, sound code and gameplay code
* Fixed music initialization volume (@deat322)
* Fixed mouse move fordward button (@deat322)
* Include full FastDoom version number (issue #72, @SpitFire-666)

## 0.8.10 (14 Mar 2022)
* Added new video modes
    * FDOOME16.EXE => FastDoom EGA 160x100
    * FDOOME36.EXE => FastDoom EGA 80x100 (122 pseudocolors)
    * FDOOMT43.EXE => FastDoom 80x43 16 colors text mode (only EGA cards)
    * FDOOMT86.EXE => FastDoom 80x43 16 colors text mode (virtual resolution of 80x86, only EGA cards)
* Multiple optimizations for special backbuffered modes
* Better colormaps / palettes for black&white modes, and 16 color dithered modes
* Removed FDOOMV.EXE, the scaling was horrible and didn't look good at all
* Revert custom palette for VGA 160x100 mode. The attribute controller requires the display to go blank to change each color association. Not doing this causes some random screen glitches while changing the palette (which I haven't been able to solve, since the hardware works this way). VGA 256 color mode doesn't have this problem

## 0.8.9 (26 Jan 2022)
* Added new video modes. Huge thanks to @FrenkelS
    * FDOOMC36.EXE => FastDoom CGA 80x100 (122 pseudocolors)
    * FDOOMV36.EXE => FastDoom VGA 80x200 (122 pseudocolors)
    * FDOOMATI.EXE => FastDoom ATI Small Wonder 640x200 (dithering 16 colors)
* Small optimization for Potato and Low detail column rendering
* Optimized Plantronics ColorPlus, EGA, CGA and Hercules modes
* Added custom palette for VGA 160x200 mode
* Optimized CGA 160x100 and VGA 160x200 rendering
* Remove FDOOMVBP.EXE. It was very buggy and problematic, and in 99% of the cases a little bit slower than FDOOMVBR.EXE
* Converted all ASM files to NASM. This allows to build FastDoom with 100% open source compilers. Borland Turbo Assembler requirement is now gone. Huge thanks to @0x90
* Fix screen flickering on 80x50 and 80x100 text modes. Use the parameter "-pagefix" in case it flickers
* New mode for PC Speakers. Based on the PWM method, a little bit better but uses more CPU 

## 0.8.8 (23 Oct 2021)
* Added new video modes
    * FDOOMC16.EXE => FastDoom CGA 160x100 and 16 colors
    * FDOOMV16.EXE => FastDoom VGA 160x200 and 16 colors
    * FDOOME.EXE   => FastDoom EGA 640x200 (dithering 16 colors)
* Added support for Sound Blaster Direct mode. This mode doesn't require IRQ nor DMA, but it's a bit slower and limited to 8-bit mono sound. Useful for PCMCIA clone cards and problematic cards/systems.
* Better CGA 320x200 and 4 colors support
* Added new screen size with a minimalistic HUD
* New command line parameter that allows showing the FPS via the debug port 0x80 (-debugPort)

## 0.8.7 (16 Aug 2021)
* Added new video modes. Huge thanks to @PickledDog for implementing these
 * FDOOMPCP.EXE => FastDoom for Plantronics ColorPlus cards. 320x200 and 16 colors!
 * FDOOMCVB.EXE => FastDoom CGA composite mode. 160x200 and 16 colors!
* New command line parameter that allows disabling the defered demos (-disabledemo)

## 0.8.6 (4 Aug 2021)
* Added new video modes (for LGR's vertical monitor). Both support page flipping.
 * FDOOMV.EXE  => FastDoom Planar 320x350 vertical mode. The base 320x200 image is stretched to 320x350 (wrong aspect ratio)
 * FDOOMV2.EXE => FastDoom Planar 320x350 vertical mode. The base 320x200 image is centered in the screen, leaving black borders
 * FDOOMT52.EXE => FastDoom Text Mode 80x100 (80x50 double height)
* Optimizations for text modes

## 0.8.5 (20 Jul 2021)
* Added new video modes
 * FDOOMT1.EXE  => FastDoom 40x25 16 colors text mode
 * FDOOMT12.EXE => FastDoom 40x25 16 colors text mode (virtual resolution of 40x50)
 * FDOOMVBD.EXE => FastDoom for VBE 2.0 cards with LFB (triple buffered), all rendering is done directly onto the video card, the same way Mode Y does. Faster for systems with slow RAM access.
* More optimizations (thanks to @RamonUnch)

## 0.8.4 (1 Jul 2021)
* Added support for two new sound cards:
    * PC Speaker digitized (1 bit, 11KHz, mono)
    * COVOX LPT DAC (8 bit, 11KHz, mono)
* Fixed issue #37

## 0.8.3 (26 Jun 2021)
* Fix buttons incorrect behaviour (#36) 
* Lowered RAM usage.

## 0.8.2 (6 Jun 2021)
* Two new executables for VBE 2.0 modes (320x200 and 8 bit color support required). Most modern video cards should be faster with this mode (Vesa Local Bus and PCI cards). Only supports high detail mode.
    * FDOOMVBR.EXE - Uses basic real mode VBE 2.0 support. Most compatible mode, if you use UniVBE, use this executable
    * FDOOMVBP.EXE - Uses protected mode extensions from VBE 2.0. Should be a little bit faster with some video cards, but it's more problematic in most circunstances
* Fixed important bug that made Ultimate Doom switches not work as expected (#32)

## 0.8.1 (24 May 2021)
* New video modes!!
    * VGA Mode 13h (320x200 256 colors, without page flipping). Same mode as Heretic/Hexen. Only high detail mode is implemented, but it's usually faster than the original Mode Y. Recomended for fast 486 processors and upwards
    * CGA (320x200 4 colors). Ugly, needs a better conversion algorithm. Requires a fast CPU. Based on Mode 13h
    * CGA (640x200 monochrome, ordered dithering 2x2). Requires a fast CPU. Based on Mode 13h
    * EGA (320x200 16 colors, page flipped, 128Kb VRAM minimum). SLOW, most ISA 8-bit EGA video cards can't update fullscreen at decent framerates. Based on Mode 13h
    * Hercules (640x400 monochrome, ordered dithering 2x2). Requires a fast CPU. Based on Mode 13h
* Added basic IWAD selector on bootup (if multiple IWADs are detected)
* Fixed Super Shotgun animation
* As always more optimizations. Now text modes are much faster
* Fixed multiple bugs
* Removed color correction parameter "-fixcolors" for 16 color modes. Easier to use

## 0.8 (14 Apr 2021)
* Better RAM usage (also reduced memory footprint)
* More code optimizations
* Compiled with the latest OpenWatcom v2 version
* Stripped episode finale texts from the executable, now are stored in external text files
* Support for Doom II BFG edition. Use the command line parameter "-bfg"
* Smaller executable thanks to UPX compression tool
* New option to render the status bar background a little bit faster. Use the command line "-simplestatusbar". It replaces the status bar background with a simple grey color.
* Two new executables: FDOOMT25, which renders in text mode at 80x25 resolution (CGA, EGA and VGA supported, 16 colors and virtual resolution of 80x50) and FDOOMT50, which renders in text mode at 80x50 resolution (VGA only, 16 colors). Both support triple buffering. These executables have reduced even more the memory footprint as multiple graphics don't need to be loaded (fonts for example). Automap feature isn't supported. This release also includes the WAD ega_pal.wad, which replaces the original colormaps to a better one for text modes.
* New command line parameter "-cga", this let's the new video modes run properly with CGA video cards
* New command line parameter "-fixcolors", this is needed to correct the 256 to 16 colors conversion, as the original Doom palette is too dark for a direct conversion.
* Unified the 386 and 486 executables, the 486 executables were always slower and bigger than the 386 ones. Never figured out why this happens, maybe you can blame OpenWatcom.
* Unified executables between different versions of Doom onto a single one. The supported wads are the following:
    * DOOM.WAD -> DOOM Registered (3 episodes)
    * DOOM1.WAD -> DOOM Shareware (1 episode)
    * DOOMU.WAD -> Ultimate DOOM (4 episodes)
    * DOOM2.WAD -> DOOM II
    * PLUTONIA.WAD -> Final DOOM The Plutonia Experiment
    * TNT.WAD -> Final DOOM TNT Evilution
* New SETUP program! I've found how to edit and compile the original IDSETUP program, and modified it to create a custom version for FastDoom.
* Renamed the configuration file from default.cfg to fdoom.cfg. Also renamed save files from doomsav*.dsg to fdoomsv*.dsg.

## 0.7 (3 Dec 2020)
* Added Stereo OPL2, OPL3 and Stereo OPL3 music support (Adlib uses basic OPL2, Sound Blaster tries to detect the best possible option)
* Added Disney Sound Source (also Tandy Sound Source) sound support. You have to manually set "snd_sfxdevice" variable in the "default.cfg" file to 12 (Disney Sound Source) or 13 (Tandy Sound Source). There are three new command line options to force the parallel port in case auto-initialization process doesn't work ("-LPT1" -> port 3bc, "-LPT2" -> port 378, "-LPT3" -> port 278). COVOX / LPT DAC is not supported.
* Fixed Gravis Ultrasound music support
* Added profiling support in the makefile (Intel Pentium processor required)
* Added option that forces 8 bit audio mixing instead of 16 bit (-8bitsound)
* Fixed potato invisible column renderer (issue #2)
* Fixed chainsaw incorrect behaviour (issue #9)
* Fixed all items respawn when loading a savegame (issue #10)
* Fixed Arch-Vile fire spawned at the wrong location (original Vanilla Doom blatant error)
* Fixed Chaingun makes two sounds firing single bullet (another Vanilla Doom error, fixed as there is no multiplayer support)
* Fixed invulnerability sky colormap
* Fixed issue #14
* Fixed issue #16
* Fixed some command line parameters not working as expected
* Removed IDMYPOS cheat
* Added VSYNC support (-vsync)
* Added new command line parameters that disable some optimizations (bypassing the saved configuration, made for benchmarking): -normalsurfaces, -normalsky, -normalshadows, -normalsprites, -stereo, -melt, -capped, -novsync, -nofps.
* All new options finally are saved in default.cfg
* As always added more optimizations (mostly ASM optimized multiplications, divisions and modulo, faster screen melting code, faster cheats detection, optimized sound code, faster potato mode [thanks @Optimus6128 !!], faster melting screen, faster flat drawing functions)

## 0.666 (15 Sep 2020)
* Renamed executable to FDOOM.EXE / FDOOM2.EXE
* Added all FastDoom display options and sound options in the options menu (only screen size option is saved, next versions will fix this)
* Added "-reverseStereo" command line option to reverse Left/Right stereo speakers. Your Sound Blaster PRO will love this.
* Added "-size |screensize|" command line option to force screen size. Values allowed are 3 to 11, being 3 the smallest possible, 10 full screen with HUD and 11 the biggest, fullscreen without HUD.
* Added "-logTimedemo" option to save the benchmark result onto the file "bench.txt". With this it's possible to run multiple FastDoom benchmarks in a batch and save the results in a single text file. Requires "-timedemo".
* Removed "-cdrom" command line option.
* Fixed bug that made some sprites look corrupted (depending on screen size, only FastDoom 0.66)
* More engine code optimizations

## 0.66 (4 Sep 2020)
* Savegames are working again (broken in 0.6). Still not compatible with vanilla doom savegames, but at least it's working (latest version with compatible savegames is 0.5).
* Potato detail mode is now selectable from the options menu. Also it's selectable by pressing F5 ingame.
* Support for unlimited sprites. Doom II MAP30 now doesn't crash if there are too many enemies. Also NUTS.WAD is partially working (albeit your 386 won't be doing 144 fps 🤣).
* Experimental new uncapped fps mode. Enabled with "-uncapped". It has rendering problems and won't interpolate movement between frames. It allows you to see how "fast" can be your pc in realtime.
* Added "-forcePQ", "-forceLQ" and "-forceHQ" parameters. It allows setting the video detail quality from command line. Useful for benchmarks.
* More internal optimizations.

## 0.6 (23 Aug 2020)
* Added option "-nomelt" to avoid melting transition while loading a new levels. For 386 pc's where this functionality it's really slow.
* Fixed bug that made the framerate choppy with fast processors
* Lot's of internal optimizations (non-recursive R_RenderBSPNode, many ideas from GBADoom). This version is faster even without lowering image quality
* Flat surfaces now have diminished lightning enabled or not. The option "-flatsurfaces" has it enabled, and the new option "-flattersurfaces" has it disabled. The option "-flattersurfaces" is MUCH faster than the previous one.

## 0.5 (13 Aug 2020)
* Faster Potato mode. Now it's 100% native potato mode and doesn't use the LQ mode to draw the screen.
* Fixed Sega Saturn shadows in potato mode.
* Added "-init" parameter, it forces the user to press a key to start the game. This makes easier to see the initialization process.
* Now it's possible to use "-nomonsters" without "-warp level". Change made to test the IA performance impact.
* Fixed AWE32 music.
* More rendering and main code optimizations.
* Bring back the gamma correction, lot's of users with CRT monitors needed this functionality (F11 key)
* Remapped autorun to F12 key

## 0.4 (27 Jul 2020)
* Added autorun support (F11 key).
* Added mono sound support. Enabled with "-mono" parameter.
* Added low quality sound support (8000Hz instead of 11025Hz). Enabled with "-lowsound" parameter.
* Fixed Doom 1.9 shareware menu.
* Included sound library into the source code, instead of using a prebuilt library. Sound cache it's still not fixed, but now it's possible to add support for new sound cards, optimizations and fix bugs. May break some sound cards support (untested Gravis Ultrasound and Pro AudioSpectrum 16).
* Optimized build options. Now there are builds for 386 and 486 processors.
* Replaced DOS/4GW with DOS/32A providing a good speedup!
* More small code optimizations

## 0.3 (18 Jun 2020)
* NEW DETAIL LEVEL: POTATO. It renders the full scene with a quarter width resolution (max 80x200). 16-bit ISA video cards can play the game full screen much better!! My Western Digital Paradise PVGA1A ISA (1989) can render the game at a constant >25 fps with a 486DX-50. Enabled with "-potato" command parameter and low detail enabled.
* Memory allocation message now is showed in Kb format
* Added FPS ingame viewer. Enabled with "-fps" command parameter
* Removed Y mouse movement (move forward/backwards)
* New option to allow more than 8Mb of memory allocation. Enabled with "-ram" command parameter
* New option to show only objects that are not far away from the player. All the enemies are still rendered as they're important. Enabled with "-near" command parameter.
* Small code optimizations

## 0.2.1 (13 Jun 2020)
* Fixed bug where any sound caused the game crash with real hardware

## 0.2 (13 Jun 2020)
* Small optimizations
* Added Sega Saturn transparency support. Enable with "-saturn"

## 0.1 (10 Jun 2020)
* Initial release
* Added FPS calculation after timedemo runs
* Removed network gaming support
* Removed joystick support
* Added option to render visplanes (ceiling and floors) without textures
* Added option to render Spectres and invisible objects like real transparent objects (harder to see, faster to render)
* Added option to render sky as a flat color
* Added option (yet to be enabled) to render Spectre and invisible objects like the Sega Saturn port did
* PC Speaker uses all sounds available 
* Lot's of optimizations to make the game run faster / smoother
* Added a basic debug interface, so you can write to a second screen in DOS (MDA, monochrome)
