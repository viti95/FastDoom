# FastDOOM
Doom port for DOS, based on PCDoom by @nukeykt. The goal of this port is to make it as fast as possible for 386/486 personal computers.

## FastDOOM vs Original

* Added FPS ingame viewer
* Added FPS calculation after timedemo runs
* Added option to render visplanes (ceiling and floors) without textures
* Added option to render walls without textures
* Added option to render Spectres and invisible objects like real transparent objects (harder to see, a little faster to render)
* Added option to render sky as a flat fixed color
* Added option to render Spectre and invisible objects like the Sega Saturn port did
* Added option to render Spectre and invisible objects like Heretic/Hexen
* New option to show only objects that are not far away from the player. All the enemies are still rendered as they're important
* PC Speaker uses all sounds available (just for fun!)
* New mode for PC Speaker (digitized sound!)
* Disney Sound Source support
* COVOX LPT DAC support
* Adlib OPL2 PCM support
* OPL2LPT and OPL3LPT support
* Tandy 3-voice PCM support (SN76489)
* Creative Music System / Game Blaster support
* Audio-CD music support
* PCM music support (through sound fx device)
* Hercules automap support
* Lot's of optimizations to make the game run faster / smoother
* Removed low memory limit (may cause crashes with low RAM)
* New detail level: Potato. It renders the full scene with a quarter width resolution (max 80x200). Much faster rendering, specially on 386 cpu's and slow 8-bit VGA ISA cards.
* Better use of system RAM (full memory allocation)
* Removed network gaming support
* Removed joystick support
* Removed Y mouse movement (move forward/backwards)
* Added autorun support (F12 key)
* Added mono sound support
* Replaced DOS/4GW with DOS/32A providing a good speedup!
* New setup program
* New video modes (Mode 13h, MDA, CGA, EGA, Hercules, Text modes, VESA 2.0, Plantronics Colorplus, Sigma Color 400, Hercules InColor)
* Advanced benchmark support
* Uncapped FPS mode support (frame interpolation, more than 35 fps)
* HiRes VESA video modes support

## Build instructions (FastDOOM)

Requirements: Linux or WSL2 on Windows.

1. Install OpenWatcom v2, NASM, GNU Make and DOSBox-X
2. Execute `source fdenv.sh`
3. Build:
    - Single executable: `build.sh <executable> <parameters>` Where: "executable" is the executable name (fdoom.exe, fdoomega.exe, ...) and "parameters" can be one of these:
        * "-clean": cleans all generated OBJs, 
        * "-stub": adds the DOS/32 stub, 
        * "-debug": generates debugging exectable, needs dbgcfg.h file to be adjusted to your needs
    - All the executables + automatic DOS/32 stubs: `buildall.sh`
    - Generate a full release package (ZIP): `package.sh`

Example to build a fresh FastDoom executable ready to use on real hardware:

```
./source fdenv.sh
./build.sh fdoom.exe -clean -stub
```

## Build instructions (FDSETUP)

Requirements: Windows 3.1 or Windows 9x

1. Install Borland C++ 4.52
2. Install Laughing Dog Screen Maker 1.14
3. Run .\FDSETUP\SCREENS\MAKE.BAT (MS-DOS)
4. Open setup.ide project in Borland C++ IDE
5. Build the project
